# HW 4 of Digital Image Processing

## Apply Filter
A generic python package that accepts a filter and whether or not it is centered already and applies the filter to fourier transform of the image.
The image will be padded to be 2n x 2m where n and m are the original size of the image. Then the image will be transformed into the frequency domain
for filter application and brought back after the filter is applied.

## Gaussian High Pass Filter
Python package to create a Gaussian High Pass filter. Centered

## Gaussian Low Pass Filter
Python package to create a Gaussian Low Pass filter. Centered.

## Ideal High Pass Filter
Python package to create an Ideal High Pass filter. Not entered.

## Ideal Low Pass Filter
Python package to create an Ideal Low Pass Filter. Not centered.

## Laplacian Filter
Python package to create a Laplacian Filter. Centered.

## Laplacian of Gaussian Filter
Python package to create a Laplacian of Gaussian Filter by multiplying the Laplacian Filter with the Gaussian.
